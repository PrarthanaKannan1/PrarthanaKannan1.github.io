# About Me
## Interests 
I have a wide range of interests that reflect both my creative and analytical sides. I have been passionate about Bharatanatyam, a classical Indian dance form, for over five years. I love being able to tell a story and express myself through movement. I also enjoy swimming and playing tennis, which help me stay active and focused.

On my creative side, I play the clarinet, and I love making digital art in my free time. These hobbies let me express myself and connect with people by sharing my music or art I have created. I also love watching movies that explore science and space, like Interstellar and The Martian. The mix of emotional storytelling and scientific curiosity is really cool to me. 

Academically, I love anything related to math or science, especially when I can explore how they apply to the real world. I find psychology fascinating because it helps me understand how people think and behave. In the future, I hope to become a doctor or work in biomedical engineering where I can combine my interests in science, technology, and helping others.

Above all, Iâ€™m a curious person who loves to ask questions and explore how things work. I enjoy learning about the world from different perspectives and challenging what I think I know.

## Websites I recommend
- [Spurious Correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) - I find this website fascinating because it shows how seemingly unrelated things like butter consumption and wind power can appear to be statistically significant. I was actually shown this website by my psychology teacher to help us remember that correlation doesn't always mean causation. As someone who loves patterns and investigation this website is great for my curiousity and helped me with psychology to never imply causation from a corralational study.
- [Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA) - This youtube channel has been the main reason I have understood and came to like chemistry. At the beginning of my chemistry semester I was struggling with understand the concepts. But once I started watching these videos I was able to understand a lot more. The clear explanations and step-by-step breakdowns helped me make deeper connections and complete worksheets without looking at any notes. It turned a subject I hated at the beginning to something I look forward to and part of the reason I want to be a biomedical engineer or doctor.
